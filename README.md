This is our default project template we will be using for each of our JS projects! from here, we can customize as needed per project.

From the index.html file, you csn remove the fab entry in the body section. It was used as a connection tests of sorts.
#
In the style.css file, you can remove the dodgerblue as it was used to test out our plumbing between files.
